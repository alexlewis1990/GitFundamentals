# git init
the 'git init' command is used to create an empty repository.

If you wanted to create a new directory and inialize a git repository, you can do so with the following commnds:
'''

mkdir NewDirectory
cd NewDirectory
git init
'''

Once inside a git repository, you can start using commands such as
[status](./status.md)
[add](./add.md)
[commit](./commit.md)
[push](./push.md)
and more.

init will create the repository in the current directory and will encapsulate all content, including other directories.
